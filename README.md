# Welcome to the Software Engineering Course

## Introduction

Welcome to Flatiron School's Software Engineering course! Over the next 700-1000
hours you will learn everything you need to know to get started as a Software
Engineer. It's going to be harder, and more rewarding than any other learning
experience you've ever had, we promise, but we're thrilled that you've joined
our community. Let's learn together.

Before diving in, we need to briefly go over a few things. In the upcoming
lessons, we'll get your personal computer set up (what we refer to as _'your
local environment'_) and walk through the process of completing and submitting
coursework.

In this lesson, though, we'd like about the structure of this course.

## Accessing Software Engineering Course Content

Our Software Engineering curriculum is divided into a series of _courses_. Each
course is a collection of many lessons, organized into topics (referred to as
_modules_ in Canvas).

You can access the courses available to you by clicking **Course** in the
navigation on the left.

Clicking on a course will display that course's home page. To access the rest of
this course's content, click **Modules** in the navigation just to the left of
this reading.

The **Modules** page displays all course content available to you. Note that
depending on which type of course you're taking, some content may only be made
available _after_ you've completed the current course materials.

## How Our Curriculum Works

As mentioned, lessons are organized into modules based on topic. Later lessons
build off the earlier ones, so it is strongly advised that you complete each
lesson in the order provided. Use the **Modules** page to go back and review
earlier content if needed. When you complete a lesson, use the **Next** button
to continue to the next lesson.

As you work through the content, you'll be able to see which lessons and modules
you've completed, started, and not started.

<img class="center image" style="height: 300px" src="images/module-progress.png" alt="completion status icons"/>

A check mark indicates you've completed that lesson. An open circle indicates a
lesson you have not started yet. A circle with a dash inside indicates a lesson
you've started, but haven't completed yet. If you've started work on a module,
it will display a cirlce with a dash inside until all of the module's required
lessons are completed.

### Lesson Types

There are a few types of lessons you'll see in this Software Engineering course.
The most basic is a **Page**, like this lesson. Here are the main lesson types
you'll see:

- Pages: These contain content to read on a particular subject. No action
  needed, just reading and learning.
- Assignments: These are lessons where action _is_ needed. Assignments can be
  many things. Some assignments will include tests for code, sometimes referred
  to as _labs_. Other assignments may just ask you to code along and apply a
  concept as you are learning it.
- Quizzes: These are included to assess your knowledge of the topics discussed.
  Quizzes will typically be placed at the end of a topic.

Portfolio projects, assessments and blog submissions will all be available in
Canvas as assignments, since they all require work to be submitted. We will
talk more about assignments in an upcoming lesson.

## Conclusion

We are comrades in a never-ending quest for knowledge. While there are no
shortcuts, we believe that by providing knowledge in an optimized order,
reinforcing knowledge with hands-on, feedback driven practice, and providing
space for discussion, you will learn quickly. Our goal is to provide the
right materials, support and structure _you_ need to discover your own love for
the code.

You're just getting started, and we're happy you're here. Continue on and happy
learning!
